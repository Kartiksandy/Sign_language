## Image Classification of American Sign Language

This project involves building and evaluating a neural network model to classify American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures. The model is trained on a dataset of hand gesture images and aims to predict the corresponding sign language letter.

### Project Overview:

1. **Objective:**
   - The primary goal is to classify ASL hand gestures into their corresponding letters using a neural network model.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Loading the Dataset:** The ASL dataset is loaded from CSV files containing images and their corresponding labels.
   - **Normalization:** The pixel values of the images are normalized to a range of 0 to 1 to ensure the model receives inputs with similar scales.
   - **Splitting the Data:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets, where the training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate it.

3. **Model Building:**
   - **Neural Network Architecture:** 
     - The model is built using TensorFlow's Keras API. 
     - It consists of three layers: two dense layers with 512 units each using ReLU activation and an output layer with 25 units using softmax activation (corresponding to the 25 letters in ASL).
   - **Model Summary:** 
     - The model summary provides an overview of the network architecture, including the number of parameters at each layer.

4. **Training and Evaluation:**
   - **Training Process:** 
     - The model is trained over 20 epochs, with training and validation accuracy logged at each epoch.
     - TensorBoard or similar tools can be used to visualize the training process.
   - **Evaluation:** 
     - The model's performance is evaluated based on training and validation accuracy, providing insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

5. **Key Findings:**
   - **Training Accuracy:** Indicates how well the model has learned the patterns in the training data.
   - **Validation Accuracy:** Measures how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.
   - **Overfitting Consideration:** If the training accuracy is high, but the validation accuracy is significantly lower, this may indicate overfitting.
